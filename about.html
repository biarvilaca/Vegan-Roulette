    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The project idea is to build a roulette of vegan recipes to help you choose what to cook/eat. It will be possible to filter what types of recipes are shown by time, difficulty, cousine type and also by pre-selecting ingredients that you either want or don't want included. There will be an option to browse trough the recipe options separately, without engaging with the roulette.</p>
    <p>This is being built as I go trough The Odin Project, therefore it will take a long time to be completed and it will go trough a lot of different stages as I gain knowledge and skill. It's early phases probably won't look like the intended idea at all, but it will get there one day!</p>
