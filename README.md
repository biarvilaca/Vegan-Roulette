The project idea is to build a roulette of vegan recipes to help you choose what to cook/eat. It will be possible to filter what types of recipes are shown by time, difficulty, cuisine type and also by pre-selecting ingredients that you either want or don't want included. There will be an option to browse trough the recipe options separately, without engaging with the roulette.

This is being built as I go trough The Odin Project, therefore it will take a long time to be completed and it will go trough a lot of different stages as I gain knowledge and skill. It's early stages probably won't look like the intended idea at all, but this Read Me document will serve as a guide to remind me and inform others of what the plan is.

Additional ideas:
- Unit conversion;
- Adjustable portion size.
